Huffman Compression and Decompression:
A Java implementation of file compression and decompression using Huffman Coding. This algorithm efficiently compresses files of any type by calculating byte frequencies and generating optimal Huffman codes. It allows flexible compression based on byte unit size (n) for different file types.
